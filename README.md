# LK21-REV-ZONE-App With Dicord RPC
The LK21 REV-ZONE wrapper that uses Discord RPC to show what you are watching using Rich Presence. Inspired by discord-youtube (https://github.com/BrianPetkovsek/discord-youtube)

# How to run 
You have to install the dependencies. So, just run npm install in the repo's folder. Once it's done, run npm start to start the application.

# Errors
If Discord is not opened, or, for some reason, the RPC Client couldn't connect to it, an error will show in the app. It disappears in 15 seconds.
Even if Discord is not opened, you can still use the app as a normal LK21 REV-ZONE wrapper.
